Incident management log for public health doctors 
------ 
 
Maintaining an individual log during an emergency is important for those managing public health incidents.  This project allows incident data and management decisions to be collated in real time in the field. It allows an end of day summary to be produced and provides an audit trail. It complements standard outbreak control systems. 
 
In a recent incident over a 30 day period it is estimated that it would have saved approximately Â£1000 - when multiplied by the number of incidents occurring daily there are substantial gains for the NHS -  in both quality of management and financial gains. 
 
 
About the Code 
------ 
The 'web_proto' directory is all JavaScript (dojo) and was just created for the look and feel of a real native smart phone app. This was created in less than 2 days at NHS hack day Liverpool (http://nhshackday.com/) by myself (Andrew Leeming) with help from my team of experienced NHS professionals: Louise Wilson, Mark Cotton, Brendan O'Brien & Andrew Bannatyne. 
 
The existence of the 'android' directory is purely a placeholder for potential future development. Ideally effort should be directed at making an iPhone native app first, but I lack the equipment to be able to do this (Physical iPhone and Apple computer for dev work).
