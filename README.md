Incident management log for public health doctors
------

Maintaining an individual log during an emergency is important for those managing public health incidents.  This project allows incident data and management decisions to be collated in real time in the field. It allows an end of day summary to be produced and provides an audit trail. It complements standard outbreak control systems.

In a recent incident over a 30 day period it is estimated that it would have saved approximately Â£1000 - when multiplied by the number of incidents occurring daily there are substantial gains for the NHS -  in both quality of management and financial gains.
